For this example, I used the data set USJudgeRatings which contains lawyer's ratings of state judges in the US Superior Court.

The variables in the dataset are listed below:

1. CONT = N. of contacts of lawyer with judge
2. INTG = Judical integrity
3. DMNR = Demeanor
4. DILG = Diligence
5. CFMG = Case flow managing
6. DECI = Prompt decisions
7. PREP = Preparation for trial
8. FAMI = Familiarity with law
9. ORAL = Sound oral rulings
10. WRIT = Sound written rulings
11. PHSY = Physical ability
12. RTEN = Worthy of retention

My goal is to simplify the data and I will approach this problem with PCA.
