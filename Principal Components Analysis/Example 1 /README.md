For this example, I used the data set USJudgeRatings which contains lawyer's ratings of state judges in the US Superior Court.

The variables in the dataset are listed below:

CONT = N. of contacts of lawyer with judge
INTG = Judical integrity
DMNR = Demeanor
DILG = Diligence
CFMG = Case flow managing
DECI = Prompt decisions
PREP = Preparation for trial
FAMI = Familiarity with law
ORAL = Sound oral rulings
WRIT = Sound written rulings
PHSY = Physical ability
RTEN = Worthy of retention

My goal is to simplify the data and I will approach this problem with PCA.
