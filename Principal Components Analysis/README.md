# Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

The goal of PCA is to replace a large number of correlated variables with a smaller number of uncorrelated variables while capturing as much information as in the original variables as possible.

The derived variables are called principal components and are linear combinations of the observed variables.
The first principal component is the one that accounts for the most variance in the original set of variables. The second principal component, and all the others to follow, also maximise the variance accounted for however, they are uncorrelated with all other principal components.
